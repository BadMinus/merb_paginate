merb_paginate
=============

This is a blatant rip-off of will_paginate to try to bring pagination to merb.

All credit goes to those dudes. It's a fantastic plugin, it just is too rails centric to use with merb out of the box. A lot of things had to be changed to not rely on the magicness of rails.

This merb plugin is very incomplete and has no specs (Hint: contribute!).

Install
=======

git clone 
cd merb_paginate
sudo rake install

Usage
=====

Using this plugin is like so in init.rb:

  dependency 'merb_paginate'
  MerbPaginate.activate! :datamapper_finder # require the custom finder for datamapper
  MerbPaginate.activate! :view_helpers # require the will_paginate view helper

I hope to have a paginate finder for each orm evenutally. (Hint: contribute!)

In the merb style (at least how I see it), it only requires the pagination array collection class at first. You must activate the model paginate finder and the view helper (will_paginate) method yourself (see above).
