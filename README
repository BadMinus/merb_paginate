merb_paginate
=============

Pagination that relies on the awesome code of the will_paginate gem.

Lots of credit goes to those dudes. It's a fantastic plugin, it just is too 
rails centric to use with merb out of the box. A lot of things had to be 
changed to not rely on the magicness of rails.

This merb plugin is very incomplete and has no specs (Hint: contribute!).

Install
=======

git clone git://github.com/myobie/merb_paginate.git
cd merb_paginate
sudo rake install

Usage
=====

Using this plugin is like so in init.rb:

  dependency 'merb_paginate'

Right now, DataMapper is the only support ORM. I hope to have a paginate finder 
for each orm evenutally. (Hint: contribute!)



Note
----

I am thinking of rewriting this to use the paginator gem, since it is already generic 
and not tied to any ORM or anything. I am very comfortable with the will_paginate code, 
so I am biased to use it, but I want to get some feedback about the paginator gem and 
if it's a good idea?
