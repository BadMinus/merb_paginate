merb_paginate
=============

Pagination that relies on the awesomeness that is the will_paginate gem.
http://errtheblog.com/posts/56-im-paginating-again

Lots of credit goes to those dudes. It's a fantastic plugin, it just is too 
rails centric to use with merb out of the box. A lot of things had to be 
changed to not rely on the magicness of rails (which is why it's not a fork 
of the project).

This merb plugin is very incomplete and has no specs (Hint: contribute!).

Install
=======

git clone git://github.com/myobie/merb_paginate.git
cd merb_paginate
sudo rake install

Example App
===========

An example app is now included in the example folder. It comes with a sqlite3
database that has some posts already in it. I am not sure if the db is cross-
platform, let me know.

Usage
=====

Using this plugin is like so in init.rb:

  dependency 'merb_paginate'

Right now, DataMapper is the only supported ORM (Sequel might work, let me know). 
I hope to have a paginate finder for each orm evenutally. (Hint: contribute!)

Using the view helper is like so:

  <%= merb_paginate @posts %>

It is almost exactly like will_paginate, except not as smart about the current controller.



Note
----
I am thinking of rewriting this to use the paginator gem, since it is already generic 
and not tied to any ORM or anything. I am very comfortable with the will_paginate code, 
so I am biased to use it, but I want to get some feedback about the paginator gem and 
if it's a good idea?

I am pretty happy with how this is working now, but if someone has any better ideas,
please pass them along. Or better yet, fork and then make it work.
